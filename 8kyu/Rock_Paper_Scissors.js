// Rules of the "Rock, Paper, Scissors" game are:

// Rock beats Scissors,
// Scissors beat Paper,
// Paper beats Rock,
// Two identical moves are a draw.
// Let's play! You will be given valid moves of two Rock, Paper, Scissors players, and have to return which player won: "Player 1 won!" for player 1, and "Player 2 won!" for player 2. In case of a draw return Draw!.

// My Solution
const rps = (p1, p2) => {
  if((p1 ==='paper' && p2 ==='rock') || (p1 ==='rock' && p2 ==='scissors') || (p1 ==='scissors' && p2 ==='paper')){
    return "Player 1 won!"
  } else if((p2 ==='paper' && p1 ==='rock') || (p2 ==='rock' && p1 ==='scissors') || (p2 ==='scissors' && p1 ==='paper')){
    return "Player 2 won!"
  } else{
    return "Draw!"
  }
};
